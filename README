This is the release version 1 of my jQuery Growl Alert Plugin. It was created for a post on programming.linnnk.com and is available for anyone to use and expand as they please. Though if bugs are found or expansions are made I do ask that you share these with us in the comments on the post about the article. The post can be found at: 

Feel free to contact me about this plugin via email, just make sure you include something in the subject that let's me know the email is in reference to this plugin or I may never read it!

Thanks and please enjoy this and be constructive in your criticism, not rude!
